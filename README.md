# AdeptMinesweeper
Minesweeper in Adept

### Cross Platform
Runs on Windows and Mac without any modifications

### Game Assets
Assets were drawn by me and licensed under CC0

### How to compile
Make sure your compiler supports version `2.1`

Navigate to the root of the project and run
`adept`

After that, you can optionally use a tool like `iexpress` to create a self-extracting executable that's bundled with the required assets and DLLs or use a tool like `Inno Setup` to create an installer.
